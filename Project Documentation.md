Atom - Ethical Brute Force ToolAtom is a lightweight, multi-threaded, and modular brute-force framework designed for security professionals and authorized penetration testers. It is built to be fast, easily extensible, and protocol-agnostic.⚠️ LEGAL DISCLAIMERThis tool is provided strictly for educational purposes and authorized security auditing.Do not use this tool against servers you do not own or do not have explicit written permission to test.Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal.The authors are not responsible for misuse or damage caused by this tool.🚀 FeaturesMulti-threaded Architecture: Uses concurrent.futures for high-speed parallel testing.Modular Design: Protocols (SSH, FTP, SMB) are isolated in separate functions, making it easy to add new ones (e.g., HTTP, RDP).Smart Input Handling: Automatically detects if you passed a single string (e.g., admin) or a file path (e.g., users.txt).fail-safe Logging: Successful credentials are immediately written to disk (atom_success.log) to prevent data loss if the script crashes.📦 InstallationLinux / macOSClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/atom.git](https://github.com/yourusername/atom.git)
cd atom
Install dependencies:pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Run the tool:python3 atom.py --help
WindowsClone or download the zip file.Open PowerShell or Command Prompt in the folder.Install dependencies (if pip is not in your PATH, use the full command):py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# OR if using a specific python path:
# & "C:/Path/To/python.exe" -m pip install -r requirements.txt
🛠 Usage GuideBasic Syntax:python atom.py -H <TARGET> -M <MODULE> [OPTIONS]
Real-World Examples1. Targeted SSH AuditTest the root user against a specific server using a password list.python atom.py -H 192.168.1.10 -u root -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -M ssh
2. Mass FTP Scan (Stop on Success)Scan a list of 100 IPs for default admin:admin credentials. Stops attacking a host once it finds a match to save bandwidth.python atom.py -H targets.txt -u admin -p admin -M ftp -f
3. High-Performance SMB AttackAttack a Windows server using 20 concurrent threads to speed up the process.python atom.py -H 192.168.1.50 -U users.txt -P passwords.txt -M smb -t 20
🔧 TroubleshootingError: Module missing (paramiko) or pip is not recognizedThis is common on Windows if Python is not added to your System PATH.Fix: Run pip via the python executable directly:python -m pip install paramiko pysmb
Error: Connection refused or TimeoutsThe target might have a firewall blocking the port.The target might be running Fail2Ban or similar IPS that banned your IP.Fix: Try reducing threads (-t 1) or adding a delay (requires code modification).📂 Project Structureatom.py: The main core logic and thread manager.requirements.txt: List of python libraries needed.atom_success.log: Automatically created file where cracked credentials are stored.🤝 ContributingWe welcome contributions!
